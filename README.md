# Django_Admin_Portal

## Project Description:
This is a Django-based RESTful Project Management System designed to manage three core entities: Users, Clients, and Projects.

The system allows for:
  1. Registration and management of clients.  
  2. Creation and assignment of projects to specific clients and users.  
  3. User-specific project views based on authentication.  
  4. Complete CRUD operations for Clients and Projects.

The system uses Django's built-in admin for user management and Django REST Framework for building APIs, along with JWT for secure authentication.

---

## Features:
1. JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication for Users.  
2. API endpoints for client registration, project creation, update, delete.  
3. Each project is tied to both a client and a user.  
4. Authenticated users can view only their assigned projects.  
5. Admin can manage all users, clients, and projects from the admin dashboard.

## Tech Stack:
1. Python 3.13  
2. Django 4.2  
3. Django REST Framework  
4. Simple JWT (for Authentication)  
5. MySQL Database
